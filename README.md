# ModelEarth Cloud

## Flask via Google Cloud

Create a [cloud/team/2025/[handle]](https://github.com/modelearth/cloud/) folder where you'll add deployment steps to launch a Flask site using Google Cloud. 

For your [handle] use lowercase firstname and optionally your last initial, or your nickname.

Our [webhook repo](https://github.com/modelearth/webhook/) has a sample with Google Cloud Flask deployment steps you can copy and improve.


## Integration with localsite navigation

1. Fork and clone our [cloud repo](https://github.com/modelearth/cloud) and [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite). 

2. Turn on GitHub Pages for both. So [account].github.io/cloud works.

3. In the "team/2025" subfolder, add a folder with your handle (firstname) from our [Member List](https://model.earth/community/members).
Use lowercase and optionally include your last initial.

4. Copy the [index.html page](https://github.com/ModelEarth/cloud/blob/main/index.html) to your new folder. Change the title to a description of the folder's content and/or add your handle in parentheses.

5. Add your code additions and document in a README.md file.

6. Submit a Pull Request (PR), and include a URL link in the following format when sending an email to Loren to pull your additions.
[account].github.io/cloud/team/2025/[handle]


Generally avoid commiting datasets in the cloud repo.  
Pull datasets directly from other GitHub repos, Google Sheets and/or APIs.
